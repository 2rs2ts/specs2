Maintenance version.

What's not to hate about regressions? After improving the collection differences checks in 2.4.7 I re-introduced the performance issue that was fixed in 2.4.6 (useless stacktrace filling) :-(

## Improvements

 * added a `MatchResult.sequence` combinator to transform a `Seq[MatchResult[T]]` into a `MatchResult[Seq[T]]`


## Fixes

 * regression: fixed the performance issue that was re-introduced in 2.4.7
 * fixed a type-inference issue with ProcessMatchers when matching the last value
