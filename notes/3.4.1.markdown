Maintenance version with some important fixes for Futures execution

## Fixes

 * added back the `MockitoFunctions` trait to `Mockito` [#353](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/353)
 * added `anyBoolean` to the list of Mockito matchers
 * don't publish the specs2 jar [#354](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/issues/354)
 * fixed the `MatchResult.mute` to remove details for `MatchFailure`
 * fixed the `ToList` instance for the `GWT` spec
 * the `Printer` trait only deals with `SpecStructure` (and not `SpecificationStructure` which depends on the environment)
