/**
 * This trait can be mixed-in a specification to allow examples to have all of their expectations being evaluated (unless
 * the example body throws an exception of course).
 *
 * All the results are collected into a list, provided by the StoredExpectations trait. These results form then the body
 * of the each example (decorated by a special ExampleFactory) so that each example returns a Result which is the summary
 * of all the individual issues.
 *
 * It must be noted that this trait relies on a mutable list to collect the results as they are created in the example body.
 * Because of this restriction, a Specification using that trait can either run sequentially or isolated.
 *
 * If the specification is neither sequential or isolated, we force it to be isolated by default.
