object EqualityMatchers extends Card {
  def title = "Equality"
  def text = s2"""
The most common type of matcher is ***`beEqualTo`*** to test for equality. There are different ways to use this matcher:

 Matcher                    |  Comment
 -------------------------- | --------------------------
 `1 must beEqualTo(1)      `| the normal way
 `1 must be_==(1)          `| with a shorter matcher
 `1 must_== 1              `| my favorite!
 `1 mustEqual 1            `| if you dislike underscores
 `1 should_== 1            `| for should lovers
 `1 === 1                  `| the ultimate shortcut
 `1 must be equalTo(1)     `| with a literate style

   *with a negation*        |
 -------------------------- |
 `1 must not be equalTo(2) `|
 `1 must_!= 2              `|
 `1 mustNotEqual 2         `|
 `1 must be_!=(2)          `|
 `1 !== 2                  `|

For some other types of equality:

 Matcher                    |  Comment
 -------------------------- | --------------------------
 `be_===                   `| same as `be_==` but can be used with some combinators like `^^^` or `toSeq` because the parameter type is kept
 `be_==~                   `| checks if `(a:A) == (b:A)` when there is an implicit conversion from B (the type of b) to A (the type of a)
 `beTheSameAs              `| checks if `a eq b` (`a must be(b)` also works)
 `beTrue, beFalse          `| shortcuts for Boolean equality
 `a ==== b                 `| similar to `a === b` but will not typecheck if `a` and `b` don't have the same type


_Note_: the `beEqualTo` matcher is using the regular `==` Scala equality. However in the case of `Arrays`, Scala `==` is just using reference equality, `eq`. So the `beEqualTo` matcher has been adapted to use the `.deep` method on `Arrays`, transforming them to `IndexedSeqs` (possibly nested), before checking for equality, so that `Array(1, 2, 3) === Array(1, 2, 3)` (despite the fact that `Array(1, 2, 3) != Array(1, 2, 3)`).

readability.
"""
}

object TraversableMatchers extends Card {
  def title = "Traversable"
  def text = s2"""
Traversables can be checked with several matchers.

If you want to check the size of a `Traversable`

 * to check if it is empty
 ${snippet{Seq() must be empty}}
 ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3) must not be empty}}

 * to check its size
 ${snippet{Seq(1, 2) must have size(2)}}
 ${snippet{Seq(1, 2) must have length(2)}} // equivalent to size

_note_: you might have to annotate the `haveSize` matcher when using some combinators. For example: `(futures: Future[Seq[Int]]) must haveSize[Seq[Int]](1).await`

 * to check its ordering (works with any type `T` which has an `Ordering`)
 ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3) must beSorted}}

Then you can check the elements which are contained in the Traversable
 
 * if a simple value is contained
 ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3) must contain(2)}}

 * if a value matching a specific matcher is contained
 ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3) must contain(be_>=(2))}}

 * if a value passing a function returning a `Result` is contained (`MatchResult`, ScalaCheck `Prop`,...)
 ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3) must contain((i: Int) => i must be_>=(2))}}

 * note that a `Seq[A]` is also a function `Int => A` so if you want to check that a sequence is contained in another you need to use a matcher
 ${snippet{Seq(Seq(1)) must contain(===(Seq(1)))}}

 * there are also 2 specialized matchers to check the string representation of the elements
 ${snippet{Seq(1234, 6237) must containMatch("23")     }}   `// matches with ".*23.*"`
 ${snippet{Seq(1234, 6234) must containPattern(".*234")}}   `// matches with !.*234"`

For each of the checks above you can indicate how many times the check should be satisfied:

 * ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3) must contain(be_>(0)).forall}}  // this will stop after the first failure
 * ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3) must contain(be_>(0)).foreach}} // this will report all failures
 * ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3) must contain(be_>(0)).atLeastOnce}}
 * ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3) must contain(be_>(2)).atMostOnce}}
 * ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3) must contain(be_>(2)).exactly(1.times)}}
 * ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3) must contain(be_>(2)).exactly(1)}}
 * ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3) must contain(be_>(1)).between(1.times, 2.times)}}
 * ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3) must contain(be_>(1)).between(1, 2)}}

The other types of checks involve comparing the Traversable elements to other elements (values, matchers, function returning a `Result`)
 
 * with a set of values
 ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3, 4) must contain(2, 4)}}
 which is the same thing as
 ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3, 4) must contain(allOf(2, 4))}}

 * with a set of matchers
 ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3, 4) must contain(allOf(be_>(0), be_>(1)))}}

 * checking that the order is satisfied
 ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3, 4) must contain(allOf(be_>(0), be_>(1)).inOrder)}}

Note that `allOf` tries to make each check at least successful once, even if that on the same value. If, on the other hand, you want to specify that each check must succeed on a *different* value you should use `onDistinctValues`. For example this will fail:
${snippet{Seq(1) must contain(allOf(1, 1)).onDistinctValues}}

The `eachOf` method does the same thing (and this example will fail as well):
${snippet{Seq(1) must contain(eachOf(1, 1))}}

Another frequent use of Traversable matchers is to check if the Traversable have the right number of elements. For this you can use:

 * `atLeast`, which is actually another name for `allOf`, where the traversable can contain more elements than required
 ${snippet{Seq(1, 2, 3, 4) must contain(atLeast(2, 4))}}

 * `atMost` where the traversable can not contain more elements than required
 ${snippet{Seq(2, 3) must contain(atMost(2, 3, 4))}}

 * `exactly` where the traversable must contain exactly the specified number of elements
 ${snippet{Seq(1, 2) must contain(exactly(2, 1))}}

The `atLeast/atMost/exactly` operators work on distinct values by default (because this is easier for counting the correspondence between actual values and expected ones). However you can use `onDistinctValues(false)` if you don't care.

Finally, if you want to get the differences between 2 traversables:

 ${snippet{Seq(2, 4, 1) must containTheSameElementsAs(Seq(1, 4, 2))}}


"""
}

object MapMatchers extends Card {
  def title = "Map"
  def text = s2"""
Maps have their own matchers as well, to check keys and values:

 * `haveKey` checks if a Map has a given key
   `Map(1 -> "1") must haveKey(1)`

 * `haveKeys` checks if a Map has several keys
   `Map(1 -> "1", 2 -> "2") must haveKeys(1, 2)`

 * `haveValue` checks if a Map has a given value
   `Map(1 -> "1") must haveValue("1")`

 * `haveValues` checks if a Map has several values
   `Map(1 -> "1", 2 -> "2") must haveValue("1", "2")`

 * `havePair` checks if a Map has a given pair of values

 * `havePairs` checks if a Map has some pairs of values
   `Map(1->"1", 2->"2", 3->"3") must havePairs(1->"1", 2->"2")`

 But Maps are also Partial Functions, so:

 * `beDefinedAt` checks if a PartialFunction is defined for a given value
   `partial must beDefinedAt(1)`

 * `beDefinedBy` checks if a PartialFunction is defined for a given value
 and returns another one
   `partial` must beDefinedBy(1 -> true)

object JsonMatchers extends Card with matcher.JsonMatchers {
  def title = "Json"
  def text =  s2"""
 [Json](http://www.json.org) is a simple data format essentially modeling recursive key-values. There are 2 matchers which can be used to verify the presence of appropriate values in Strings representing Json documents:

 * `/(value)` checks if a value is present at the root of the document. This can only be the case if that document is an Array

 * `/(regex)` checks if a value matching the regex is present at the root of the document. This can only be the case if that document is an Array

 * `/(key -> value)` checks if a pair is present at the root of the document. This can only be the case if that document is a Map

 * `*/(value)` checks if a value is present anywhere in the document, either as an entry in an Array, or as the value for a key in a Map

 * `*/(key -> value)` checks if a pair is present anywhere in a Map of the document

 * `/#(i)` selects the ith element in a 0-based indexed Array or a Map and allow further checks on that element

Now the interesting part comes from the fact that those matchers can be chained to search specific paths in the Json document. For example, for the following document: ${snippet{

// taken from an example in the Lift project
val person = """{
  "person": {
    "name": "Joe",
    "age": 35,
    "spouse": {
      "person": {
        "name": "Marilyn",
        "age": 33
      }
    }
  }
}
"""
// 8<--
()
}}

You can use these combinations: ${snippet{

person must /("person") */("person") /("age" -> 33.0) // by default numbers are parsed as Doubles

}}

You can as well use regular expressions or String matchers instead of values to verify the presence of keys or elements. For example: ${snippet{

person must /("p.*".r) */ ".*on".r /("age" -> "\\d+\\.\\d".r)
person must /("p.*".r) */ ".*on".r /("age" -> startWith("3"))
person must /("p.*".r) */ ".*on".r /("age" -> (be_>(30) ^^ ((_:String).toInt)))

}}

Finally you can access some records by their index: ${snippet{

person must /("person") /# 2 / "person"

}}

object FileMatchers extends Card {

The Java api for files is more or less mimicked as matchers which can operate on strings denoting paths or on Files (with the `org.specs2.matcher.FileMatchers` trait)

}

object ContentMatchers extends Card with matcher.ContentMatchers {
  def title = "Content"
  def text = s2"""

##### File contents

The matchers from the `org.specs2.matcher.ContentMatchers` trait can help us check the contents of files. For example we can check that 2 text files have the same lines: ${snippet{
(file1, file2) must haveSameLines
file1 must haveSameLinesAs(file2)
}}

We can check that the content of one file is contained in another one: ${snippet{

file1 must containLines(file2)

}}

If the files are binary files we can also check that they have the same MD5 hash: ${snippet{

 (file1, file2) must haveSameMD5
 file1 must haveSameMD5As(file2)

}}

***Order***

It is possible to relax the constraint by requiring the equality or containment to be true regardless of the order of lines: ${snippet{

 (file1, file2) must haveSameLines.unordered
 file1 must haveSameLinesAs(file2).unordered
 file1 must containLines(file2).unordered
}}

***Missing only***

By default, `(file1, file2) must haveSameLines` will report misplaced lines if any, that is, lines of `f1` which appear in `f2` but not at the right position. However if `file2` is big, this search might degrade the performances. In that case you can turn it off with `missingOnly`: ${snippet{

 (file1, file2) must haveSameLines.missingOnly

}}

***Show less differences***

If there are too many differences, you can specify that you only want the first 10: ${snippet{

 (file1, file2) must haveSameLines.showOnly(10.differences).unordered

}}

In the code above `10.differences` builds a `DifferenceFilter` which is merely a filtering function: `(lines1: Seq[String], lines2: Seq[String]) => (Seq[String], Seq[String])`. The parameter `lines1` is the sequence of lines not found in the second content while `lines2` is the sequence of lines not found in the first content.

##### Directories contents

We can compare the contents of 2 directories. We can for example check if no files are missing and none has been added: ${snippet{

actualDir must haveSamePathsAs(expectedDir)
// with a file filter applied to both the actual and expected directories
actualDir must haveSamePathsAs(expectedDir).withFilter((file: File) => !file.isHidden)

}}

Once we know that all files are present we can check their content: ${snippet{

// the default comparison expects that files are text files and that comparison must be done line by line
actualDir must haveSameFilesAs(expectedDir)

// with a file filter applied to both the actual and expected directories
actualDir must haveSameFilesAs(expectedDir).withFilter((file: File) => !file.isHidden)

// with a MD5 matcher for binary files
actualDir must haveSameFilesAs(expectedDir).withMatcher(haveSameMD5)

// it is also possible to only check the content of actual files when they exist in the expected directory
actualDir must haveSameFilesContentAs(expectedDir)

}}


##### Lines contents

Files are not the only possible source of lines and it is useful to be able to check the content of a `File` with a `Seq[String]`: ${snippet{

file1 must haveSameLinesAs(Seq(line1, line2, line3))

}}

This is because those 2 types implement the `org.specs2.text.LinesContent` trait, defining:

 * a name for the overall content
 * a method for returning the lines
 * a default method for computing the differences of 2 sequences of lines (in case you need to override this logic)

So if you have a specific type `T` which you can represent as a `Seq[String]`, you can create an implicit `LinesContent` and then you'll be able to use the `ContentMatchers`: ${snippet{

implicit def linesforMyType[T]: LinesContent[T] = new LinesContent[T] {
  def name(t: T) = "My list of lines"
  def lines(t: T): Seq[String] = Seq()// your implementation goes here
}

object TerminationMatchers extends Card with matcher.TerminationMatchers with time.TimeConversions {
  def title = "Termination"
  def text = s2"""

Sometimes you just want to specify that a block of code is going to terminate. The `${fullName[matcher.TerminationMatchers]}` trait is here to help. If you mix in that trait, you can write: ${snippet{

Thread.sleep(100) must terminate

// the default is retries=0, sleep=100.millis
Thread.sleep(100) must terminate(retries=1, sleep=60.millis)

}}

Note that the behaviour of this matcher is a bit different from the `eventually` operator. In this case, we let the current Thread sleep during the given `sleep` time and then we check if the computation is finished, then, we retry for the given number of `retries`.

In a further scenario, we might want to check that triggering another action is able to unblock the first one: ${snippet{

action1 must terminate.when(action2)
action1 must terminate.when("starting the second action", action2)
action1 must terminate(retries=3, sleep=100.millis).when(action2)
}}

When a second action is specified like that, `action1` will be started and `action2` will be started on the first retry. Otherwise, if you want to specify that `action1` can *only* terminate when `action2` is started, you write: ${snippet{

action1 must terminate.onlyWhen(action2)
}}

Scala provides a parsing library using [parser combinators](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/parsing/combinator/Parsers.html).

You can specify your own parsers by:

 * extending the `ParserMatchers` trait
 * associating the `val parsers` variable with your parsers definition
 * using the `beASuccess`, `beAFailure`, `succeedOn`, `failOn`, `errorOn` matchers to specify the results of parsing input
 strings. `beAPartialSuccess`, `be aPartialSuccess`, `succeedOn.partially` will allow a successful match only on part of the input
 * using `haveSuccessResult` and `haveFailureMsg` to specify what happens *only* on success or failure. Those matchers accept
 a String or a matcher so that
 . `haveSuccessResult("r") <==> haveSuccessResult(beMatching(".*r.*") ^^ ((_:Any).toString)`
 . `haveFailingMsg("m") <==> haveFailingMsg(beMatching(".*r.*"))`

For example, specifying a Parser for numbers could look like this: ${snippet{

import util.parsing.combinator.RegexParsers
import NumberParsers.{number, error}

class ParserSpec extends Specification with matcher.ParserMatchers {  def is = s2"""
  Parsers for numbers

    ${ number must succeedOn("12").withResult(equalTo(12)) }
    ${ number("1") must haveSuccessResult("1") }

    ${ number must failOn("abc") }
    ${ number must failOn("abc").withMsg("string matching regex.*expected") }
    ${ number must failOn("abc").withMsg(matching(".*string matching regex.*expected.*")) }

object DependencyMatchers extends Card with specification.Analysis with UserGuideVariables {
  def title = "Dependency Matchers"
  def text = s2"""
It is highly desirable to have acyclic dependencies between the packages of a project. This often leads to describing the packages structure as "layered": each package on a layer can only depend on a package on a lower layer. ***specs2*** helps you enforce this design property with specific matchers.

***Layers definition***

First you need to define the packages and their expected dependencies. Mix-in the `${fullName[specification.Analysis]}` trait and define, (taking ***specs2*** as an example): ${snippet{

layers (
  "runner",
  "reporter",
  "specification mutable",
  "mock      form",
  "matcher",
  "execute",
  "reflect    xml  time html",
  "collection control io text main data").withPrefix("org.specs2")
}}

The above expression defines layers as an ordered list of `String`s containing space-separated package names. It is supplemented by a `withPrefix` declaration to factor out the common package prefix between all these packages.

By default, the packages are supposed to correspond to directories in the `src/target/scala-<version>/classes` directory. If your project has a different layout you can declare another target directory: ${snippet{

layers("...").inTargetDir("out/classes")
}}

**Inclusion/Exclusion**

Every rule has exceptions :-). In some rare cases, it might be desirable to exclude a class from being checked on a given layer. To do this, you can use the `include/exclude` methods on the `Layer` class: ${snippet{

layers (
  "runner",
  "reporter",
  "specification mutable".exclude("mutable.SpecificationWithJUnit"),
  "mock      form",
  "matcher",
  "execute",
  "reflect  xml  time html",
  "collection control io text main data").withPrefix("org.specs2")
}}

The `include/exclude` methods accept a list of regular expressions to:

- exclude fully qualified class names (generally, only `exclude` will be necessary)
- re-include fully qualified class names if the exclusion list is to big

***Verification***

Now you've defined layers, you can use the `beRespected` matcher to check if all the dependencies are verified: ${snippet{

val design = layers("...")
design must beRespected
}}

If some dependencies are not respected:

```
those dependencies are not satisfied:
org.specs2.main x-> org.specs2.io because org.specs2.io.FileSystem -> org.specs2.main.Arguments
org.specs2.main x-> org.specs2.io because org.specs2.io.FileSystem -> org.specs2.main.ArgumentsArgs
```

***Layers as an `Example`***

The `${fullName[specification.Analysis]}` trait allows to directly embed the layers definition in a `Specification` and turn it into an `Example`: ${snippet{

class DependenciesSpec extends Specification with specification.Analysis { def is =
  "this is the application design" ^
    layers(
      "gui commandline",
      "controller",
      "backend"
    )
}
}}

***Alternative implementation***

Another implementation of the same functionality is available through the `org.specs2.analysis.CompilerDependencyFinder` trait. This implementation uses the compiler dependency analysis functionality but needs more time, since it recompiles the sources.

The source files are taken from the `src/main/scala` directory by default but you can change this value by using the `Layers.inSourceDir` method.

While this implementation is slower than the Classycle one, it might retrieve more dependencies, for example when constants are inlined in class files.

Note: since this functionality relies on the scala compiler library, so you need to add it to your build file:

```
// use sbt's scalaVersion Setting to define the scala-compiler library version
libraryDependencies <<= scalaVersion { scala_version => Seq(
  "org.specs2" %% "specs2" % $VERSION % "test",
  "org.scala-lang" % "scala-compiler" % scala_version % "test")
}
```
"""
