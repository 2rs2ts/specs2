### Unit specifications

#### Methods

Those are all the methods which you can use to create fragments in a unit specification:

 * `can`: create a group of Examples, with the preceding Text fragment appended with `can` ${snippet{

"a configuration" can {
  "have a name" in ok
}
}}

 * <code class="prettyprint">&#62;&#62;</code>: create an Example or a group of Examples (with no appended text) ${snippet{

"a configuration may" >> {
  "have a name" in ok
}
}}

Note that you can use a `for` loop to create examples with the `examplesBlock` method: ${snippet{

"this system has 5 examples" >> {
  //examplesBlock {
    (1 to 5) foreach { i => "example "+i >> ok }
 //}
}
}}

And you can also use a `for` loop with the `Result.unit` method to create a block of expectations: ${snippet{

"this example has 5 expectations" in {
  Result.unit { (1 to 5) foreach { i => i must_== i } }
}
}}

 * `title`: give a title to the Specification ${snippet{

"My spec title".title
// an url path can be used to specify a different path for the html reporting
"My spec title".title //.urlIs("com/MySpec.html")
}}

 * `args`: create arguments for the specification

 * `.txt` or `textFragment`: create a `Text` fragment ${snippet{
"this is a text fragment".txt

text("this is a text fragment")
}}

 * `step`: create a `Step` ${snippet{
step { initializeDatabase() }
}}

 * `action`: create an `Action` ${snippet{
action { justDoIt() }
}}

 * `link`: create a link to another specification ${snippet{
//link("how" ~ ("to do hello world", new HelloWorldSpec))
}}

 * `see`: add a link to another specification without including its fragments for execution ${snippet{
link(new HelloWorldSpec)
}}

 * `include` to include another specification ${snippet{
link(new HelloWorldSpec)
}}

 * `p, br, t, bt, end, endp`: add a formatting fragment

#### Full example

To make things more concrete here is a full example: ${snippet{

import mutable._
import specification._
import execute.Success

/**
 * This specification shows how to use the mutable.Specification trait to create a unit Specification
 * where the fragments are built using a mutable variable
 */
class MutableSpec extends Specification {

  // A title can be added at the beginning of the specification
  "MutableSpec".title
  // arguments are simply declared at the beginning of the specification if needed
  args(xonly=true)

  "This is a unit specification showing the use of different methods".txt

  // a step to execute before the specification must be declared first
  step {
    // setup your data or initialize your database here
    success
  }

  "'Hello world'" should {
    "contain 11 characters" in {
      "Hello world" must have size(11)
    }
    "start with 'Hello'" in {
      "Hello world" must startWith("Hello")
    }
    /**
     * a failing example will stop right away, without having to "chain" expectations
     */
    "with 'world'" in {
      // Expectations are throwing exception by default so uncommenting this line will
      // stop the execution right away with a Failure
      // "Hello world" must startWith("Hi")

      "Hello world" must endWith("world")
    }
  }
  /**
   * "Context management" is handled through the use of traits or case classes
   */
  "'Hey you'" should {
    // this one uses a "before" method
    "contain 7 characters" in context {
      "Hey you" must have size(7)
    }
    // System is a Success result. If the expectations fail when building the object, the example will fail
    "contain 7 characters" in new system {
      string must have size(7)
    }
    // otherwise a case class can be used but the example body will be further down the file
    "contain 7 characters" in system2().e1
  }
  // you can add links to other specifications with `link`
  // they will be executed when this one is executed. If you don't want this to happen
  // you can use `see` instead of `link`
  //link("how" ~ ("to do hello world", new HelloWorldSpec))
  // you can include other specifications with `include`
  link(new HelloWorldSpec)

  // a step to execute after the specification must be declared at the end
  step {
    // close the database here
    success
  }


  object context extends org.specs2.mutable.Before {
    def before = () // do something to setup the context
  }
  // we need to extend Scope to be used as an Example body
  trait system extends Scope {

    val string = "Hey you"
    def e1 = string must have size(7)
