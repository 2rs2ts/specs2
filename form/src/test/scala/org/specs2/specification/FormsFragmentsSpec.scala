 A form can be added as a Fragment in a specification
   creating a new Text Fragment                                                      ${frags.e1_1}
   showing all expected values                                                       ${frags.e1_2}
   in an interpolated spec                                                           ${frags.e1_3}

 It can also be added as the body of an example
   returning success if the form is a success                                        ${frags.e2}
   returning a failure if one property in the  form fails                            ${frags.e3}
